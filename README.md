### 2. Download the Software
On the Releases page, look for the version labeled **Latest Release**. Click on it to view the available files. Find the option that best suits your operating system and click to download.

### 3. Extract the Files
After downloading, locate the compressed file (usually a `.zip` or `.tar.gz`). Right-click on the file and choose **Extract All** or use a similar option provided by your operating system to extract the files to a folder of your choice.

### 4. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
You will need to open a terminal window. You can do this by:
- Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
- macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit `Enter`.
- Linux: Open your favorite terminal application.

### 5. Navigate to the Extracted Folder
In the terminal, use the `cd` command to change the directory to the folder where you extracted the files. For example:
```bash
cd path/to/your/extracted/folder
```

### 6. Install Dependencies
Next, you need to install the required libraries. Type the following command and hit `Enter`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command installs all necessary packages listed in the requirements file.

### 7. Configuration
Before running the application, you may need to set up your Facebook login credentials. Open the provided configuration file (e.g., `config.py`), and fill in your details.

### 8. Run the Application
Finally, you can run the application by entering this command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the scraper, and it will prompt you to enter keywords to fetch relevant posts.

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines
- **Keywords:** Input relevant keywords to find targeted posts. The more specific your keywords, the more accurate the results.
- **Facebook Account:** Ensure the Facebook account you use is set to public if you want to scrape posts from public pages.
- **Frequency:** Be mindful of how often you run the scraper to avoid being flagged by Facebook.
